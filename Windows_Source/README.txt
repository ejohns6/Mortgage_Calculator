Description:
Program where you can see how long it takes to pay of mortage with normal monthly
payments and abnormal payments here and there

Important Note: Qt is write code once and compile on every system. So if you want to
    have an mac OS version then compile on a mac OS or a VM of it



Was Developed using Qt

To deploy in Windows:
1. Have exe complied and txt files
2. Open console in qt bin folder version that you are using
3. run qtenv2.bat
4. run windeployqt.exe
5. change directory to where the exe compiled file is
6. run windeployqt.exe --quick --no-translations .

To Deploy in Mac OS
1. Have exe complied and txt files
2. Open console in qt bin folder QTDIR/bin/macdeployqt (a.k.a. Qt/5.12.2/clang_64/bin/macdeployqt
3. run $ QTDIR/bin/macdeployqt <path to app file generated by build>/appFile.app

To Copy Files that are like other files add this to .pro code:
copydata.commands = $(COPY_DIR) $$PWD/{File Name} $$OUT_PWD
first.depends = $(first) copydata
export(first.depends)
export(copydata.commands)
QMAKE_EXTRA_TARGETS += first copydata

Notes (Author: stackoverflow id: https://stackoverflow.com/users/4694916/lumos0815):
    -You can add as many $$PWD/{File Name} as you need before $$OUT_PWD

Key Notes:
-The InputData.txt file MUST BE SAME LEVEL as the app
-Any line with # will not be read in
-Main Data Must be in order of:
    1. Mortage Amount - dollars with no commas
    2. Yearly Interest Rate - 0 - 100% per year
    3. Normal Monnthly Payment - dollars with no commas
    4. Abnormal Monthly Payments - YYYY MM Money
        4a. YYYY is years with 4 digits like 0000 - 9999
        4b. MM is months ranging from 01 - 12
        4c. Money is any digit ranging from 0.00 - 99999999999.00
- Any Date that is ealier than the current date is not a valid date and will not be considered
- The Dates can be in any order
- The File must be called "InputData.txt" in the directory
- Difference in opening the file:
    -Mac: QFile InputData(QString(QCoreApplication::applicationDirPath().toUtf8().constData()) + "/../../../InputData.txt");
    -Windows: QFile InputtData(QCoreApplication::applicationDirPath() + "/InputData.txt");
        -This needs QCoreApplication


Under this is an example Templete


# Mortgage Amount($):
200000.32
# Yearly Interest Rate(%):
3.2
# Normal Monthly Payment:
2123.00
# Abnorrmal Payments(Seperated by One Space):
# Year Month Amount
#----------------------------------------------------
2020 10 5000
2021 01 2000
2022 03 20000
2020 03 2000
2020 03 6000
1999 01 10000
